# Pwnbooks-BinaryExploitation 📙

## What is This?❓
A large archive of writeups for the CTF competition's Binary Exploitation category with the purpose of educating other CTF competitors about hacking techniques.

## Who Writes These? 🤷‍♂️
All of these writeups are written by me :D (Shuban Pal)

CTF is one of my favorite passtime activities. I also like to document many of my solutions for CTF problems in the form of writeups.

CTFs I have played in:
```
PicoCTF 2022 (First CTF)
HSCTF 9
Imaginary CTF 2022
PicoCTF 2023
HSCTF 10
Imaginary CTF 2023
PicoCTF 2024
UTCTF 2024 
SwampCTF 2024 
PlaidCTF 2024
Cyber@CIT CTF 2024
CPCTF 2024 Individuals 
```

However, I may also include writeups from old or other CTFs I have not competed in



### My CTF Experience

I am not a competitive player, I play CTF rather casually with friends as a sort of computer science puzzle. I mainly do `Binary Exploitation` (also called `Pwn`) in CTF competitions and have experience in using tools such as:

- 🐍Python
- 🥷Pwntools
- 🦗 GNU Debugger (GDB)
- 🐧Linux
- 🐉Ghidra

I am not a security professional, I am just a high schooler learning and improving my Pwn and Binary Exploitation skills. As I improve, I will make sure to go back and improve the quality of any of the content stored here and I will also expand this collection to fit more complex problems.
