# PicoPwnbooks-BinaryExploitation 📙

## What is This?❓
A large archive of writeups for the PicoCTF competition's Binary Exploitation category with the purpose of educating other CTF competitors about hacking techniques.

## Background 
PicoCTF is an annual cybersecurity competition held by professionals from Carnegie Mellon University which challenges competitors’ problem solving skills with various tasks with the objective to obtain a flag to get points. Each task has a slight description, followed with an instance button or a file. With the goal in mind of getting the flag, the competitor must exploit computer related vulnerabilities to extract the flag even though it may seem impossible at first in some cases.


## Who Writes These? 🤷‍♂️
All of these writeups are written by me :D (Shuban Pal)

CTF is one of my favorite passtime activities. So everytime I get to solve a CTF problem, a part of the joy I gain is sharing my thought process to others.

### My Pico Experience

I am not a competitive player, I play CTF rather casually with friends as a sort of computer science puzzle. I mainly do `Binary Exploitation` (also called `Pwn`) in CTF competitions and have experience in using tools such as:

- 🐍Python
- 🥷Pwntools
- 🦗 GNU Debugger (GDB)
- 🐧Linux
- 🐉Ghidra

I am not a security professional, I am just a high schooler learning and improving my Pwn and Binary Exploitation skills. As I improve, I will make sure to go back and improve the quality of any of the content stored here and I will also expand this collection to fit more complex problems.
